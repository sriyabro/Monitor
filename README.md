# Monitor App
## Cloud-based Sensor Monitoring and Alert Management Platform

This system is a cloud-based sensor monitoring and alert management platform that allows you to centrally monitor any device regardless of its location. 

The main functionality of the system is to alert certain events based on sensor readings through the selected notification channel. (Email, Text, Voice)

The system can collect readings provided by third party sensor data providers such as Aretas, Imonnit and Helium for various sensor types such as temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors. (Currently supports only temperature sensors)
